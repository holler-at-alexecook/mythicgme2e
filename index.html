  <h1>A Discarded Magical Warrior</h1>
  <h2>Tales of what happens after the Conflict...</h2>
</header>
<section>
  <article>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>You are... old news. No longer needed, wanted, or able; just left by the wayside, discarded.</p>
    <p>Once you were great, a shining light eclipsing all others. You were capable of so much, wielding more power at your fingertips than few others in existence. You fought at the front lines, the chosen champion, meant to bring about the end of the war. To bring about some resolution to the long-standing strife.</p>
    <aside>
      <img src="https://holler-at-alexecook.github.io/mythicgme2e/magicalwarriormale002-min.png" alt="">
    </aside>
    <p>And you did! You accomplished all that and more, in your way. But then...</p>
    <p>You were told many things, and given many promises but it amounted to one thing - you were not needed any longer. The gifts, the trinkets, resources, instruments of war and even the friends you had made - all gone. The task, once something you&#39;d call your destiny, has been completed.</p>
    <p>&quot;Now what?&quot; You wonder, contemplating your next step...</p>
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>&#39;A Discarded Magical Warrior&#39; is about what happens AFTER the war is won. Your character, at one time, wielded immense power. Now, these days, they wield a mop. Your character fought dozens, maybe hundreds, of others without breaking a sweat; now they can&#39;t punch without hurting their fist. They&#39;ve grown up and learned a lot about life quicker than any of their peers.</p>
    <p>What happens when the magical becomes the mundane again?</p>
    <h3 id="purpose">Purpose</h3>
    <p>This is a story seed, a brief with setting notes and character ideas for you to use to start your tale. Take all of these ideas or only some and use the questions posed to create your character and begin your adventure!</p>
    <p>Designed to be used with the Mythic Game Master Emulator 2e, this story seed will help you begin a new solo roleplaying campaign.</p>
    <h3 id="inspiration">Inspiration</h3>
    <p>The inspiration for this came from the Henshin Hero trope which includes things like He-Man &amp; She-Ra, Adventure Time, Steven Universe, Gundam, Neon Genesis Evangelion, Robotech, King Arthur, Guy Gardner, Jem and the Holograms, Madoka Magica, Ben 10, Captain Marvel/Shazam, Freakazoid, Trollhunters, Fire Emblem, Kingdom Hearts, Mario and his various costumes</p>
    <h3 id="how-to-use">How To Use</h3>
    <p>A story seed seeks to describe a setting or a character archetype, and pose a range of questions to help guide you while creating an original take on the concept. With those answers, you&#39;ll have a whole new setting to explore and learn more about as you play.</p>
    <p>This story seed is broken up into a few sections. </p>
    <p>The first, Character Creation, asks a range of questions to help you create who your character was and who they are now, as well as other important details like who (or what) gave you these abilities, and what was the reason you were picked in the first place.</p>
    <p>The next, Story Creation, poses questions about the Conflict itself and your role in it. How did it start, escalate, and ultimately end? This will help you flesh out your character&#39;s backstory and explain why they are in the place they are when the adventure begins.</p>
    <p>Both of these sections ask you a variety of questions that will help you create your character and the setting they exist in. Don&#39;t worry about answering all of the questions, 2-3 tend to give a player enough Context to come up with the rest of the necessary details. If needed, roll twice on the Meaning Table of your choice or ask some Fate Questions for some inspiration.</p>
    <p>Finally, it&#39;s time to play! Using the answers to the questions provided in this story seed, you can add Characters and Threads to your lists and start constructing your first scene.</p>
    <p>To wrap things up there is The Big Example detailing the tumultuous times known as &quot;The Pizza Wars&quot; as well as a few helpful tables to add some random elements to your character and setting.</p>
    <h2>Character Creation</h2>
    <h3 id="who-was-your-character">Who Was Your Character</h3>
    <p>Let&#39;s start with who your character was. Before the life-changing event and the Conflict itself, what was your character like then? Taking time to flesh out who the character was will help give you more Context as you continue to craft the character&#39;s backstory.</p>
    <p class="no-margin">Questions to think about:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>How did your character grow up, and under what economic circumstances?</li>
      <li>What was a long-term goal your character had?</li>
      <li>What is one innate strength and an area of expertise?</li>
      <li>What are some flaws, unique mannerisms or vocal patterns the character has?</li>
      <li>How does the character react to a crisis?</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="indent"><em>The Player starts with a 17-year-old girl named Yuki Nakamura. Yuki is a free-spirited, open-minded, and adventurous individual who values independence, curiosity, and self-discovery. Growing up, and raised by her grandparents, Yuki was a curious and adventurous child, often wandering the countryside and exploring the nearby forests. Despite her grandparents&#39; traditional values, Yuki has always been drawn to the outside world and yearns to see more of it. She has a thirst to see more of the world and is trying to find a way to leave her rural life behind.</em></p>
    <h3 id="who-was-your-alter-ego">Who Was Your Alter Ego</h3>
    <p>Next, we will construct what your character&#39;s alter ego was capable of. Picture characters like He-Man or Sailor Moon; Shinji or Madoka - what powers did they have in their altered form? Working out some details about how the character transformed into their alter ego and what abilities they had will continue to shape the setting you will be playing in.</p>
    <p>Questions to think about:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>What powers did the alter ego have?</li>
      <li>How did your character transform into its alter ego?</li>
      <li>What did the alter ego look like?</li>
      <li>How old did your character&#39;s alter ego appear?</li>
      <li>When did your character transform for the first time?</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="indent"><em>Unsure of what type of alter ego Yuki would have, the Player turns to the Meaning Table: Actions. They roll a 14 and 94 or &quot;Block and Vehicle&quot;, resulting in Yuki&#39;s alter ego becoming a human-vehicle hybrid, a blocky tank-like shell forming over her body as she transforms and giving her wheels for travel. The Player also decides on a range of assault rifles and other armaments attached to the shoulder pads of her alter ego&#39;s form, making Yuki a literal Tank that is still nimble and feminine with additional details added to finish off her altered appearance.</em></p>
    <h3 id="who-was-your-patron">Who Was Your Patron</h3>
    <p>Some entity was involved in your character being able to transform into its alter ego. Your character was granted some means to access powers far beyond their kin and your character&#39;s patron played some part in it; willingly or unwillingly, on purpose or by accident someone was involved somehow. This is where we take the time to figure out who.</p>
    <p>Questions to think about:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Was your character&#39;s patron humanoid, alien, or a spirit of some kind? </li>
      <li>Was your character&#39;s patron acting alone, or were they part of a larger organization?</li>
      <li>Was there a deal made between your character and the patron?</li>
      <li>How involved was your character&#39;s patron?</li>
      <li>What was your character&#39;s patron&#39;s social status?</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="indent"><em>The Player is unsure of the origin of Yuki&#39;s abilities, so they turn to Fate Questions to figure it out. They ask &quot;Was Yuki&#39;s patron an alien?&quot; and assign it a probability of Unlikely. But when the roll comes back as an Exceptional Yes, the Player concludes that the alien patron is so otherworldly that Yuki couldn&#39;t understand them, possibly coming from an extradimensional realm. Given this the Play thinks their motives will remain a mystery, leaving the Player with more questions than answers.</em></p>
    <h3 id="who-is-your-character-now">Who Is Your Character Now</h3>
    <p>You know what your character was and what they could do; now let&#39;s work out where they are these days and what has changed. They&#39;ve been fired for all intents and purposes, left to their own devices to figure out what to do with their life now. How has that affected your character?</p>
    <p>Questions to think about:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>How old are you; or how much time has passed since the Conflict ended?</li>
      <li>What does your character do to survive?</li>
      <li>Did things end amicably with your former patron?</li>
      <li>Are you scarred in any way, physically or mentally?</li>
      <li>How are you coping with the loss?</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="indent"><em>Yuki was a tank, and tanks fought hard, the Player surmises. Yuki would not have gotten out unscratched. They decide to roll on the Possible Lingering Injuries table (found at the end of this document) resulting in &quot;Minor Scar&quot; and &quot;Horrible Scar&quot;. The Player decides Yuki&#39;s back and legs are scarred, as well as a gash near her upper lip pulling it into a constant smirk. A smirk that doesn&#39;t reach her eyes. Yuki also suffers from some form of PTSD, though who would she ever talk to about it? The Player makes a note of another possible thread.</em></p>
    <h2>Story Creation</h2>
    <h3 id="what-was-the-conflict-about">What Was The Conflict About</h3>
    <p>We&#39;ve spent time on your character, but we need to find out what happened to them since then and now. By taking time to create some details about your character you will have plenty of Context to use when coming up with answers to some of the questions in this section. Your character fought in some Conflict in some way, and it&#39;s up to you to start defining what that was.</p>
    <p class="no-margin">Questions to think about:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>How did the conflict begin?</li>
      <li>Who were the major players in the conflict?</li>
      <li>What notable battles or confrontations happened?</li>
      <li>How did the conflict come to an end and who won?</li>
      <li>Which side was your character on and what role did they play?</li>
    </ol>

    </aside>
    <p class="indent"><em>The Player delves into the Fate Chart, determined to uncover the mysterious origins of Yuki&#39;s abilities and the conflict that sparked her journey. Their rolls lead them to an innocent scientist who, in a fateful accident, punctured a hole in the very fabric of reality, inciting the wrath of extra-dimensional beings.</em></p>
    <p class="indent"><em>The scientist, it turns out, was employed by a military-funded think tank, which harnessed the energy from the breach to create a myriad of technological advances. One was the ability to create small pocket dimensions and crystals that granted access to them. The crystal opened a gateway to a personal armory where Yuki&#39;s powerful battlesuit lay in wait. However, each time Yuki donned the suit, the crystals inflicted burns and wounds upon her, a painful reminder that &quot;everything has a cost.&quot;</em></p>
    <p class="indent"><em>Yuki and the others that the think tank had picked to become their soldiers were part of &quot;Tactical Operations Y&quot; or T.O.Y.</em></p>
    <p class="indent"><em>In the end, a shocking revelation shatters everything Yuki thought she knew. The energy powering the think tank&#39;s T.O.Y. Soldiers was sourced from the very beings they were fighting against; it was their blood, literally. This truth causes widespread defection and in-fighting, ultimately leading to an explosive end for the think tank, and leaving Yuki to pick up the pieces of her shattered world, powerless and questioning her next steps.</em></p>
    <h2>The Big Example - The Pizza Wars</h2>
    <h3 id="who-was-your-character">Who Was Your Character</h3>
    <p>For this example, the Player went in with an idea already formed - what would a war between pizzerias be like? Based on real-world events (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion%27s_Piazza">"The Dayton OH Pizza Wars"</a>) with a henshin bend, the Player starts to create their character.</p>
    <p>The Player decides Tyler is a young and ambitious pizza delivery boy who&#39;s living his best life in a small town. Despite growing up with a single mom and facing financial struggles, Tyler&#39;s mom instilled in him a strong work ethic and the value of responsibility. So he started delivering pizzas after school, and boy is he good at it! He&#39;s like a mini pizza-delivering ninja, navigating the streets of his hometown with the precision of a GPS.</p>
    <p>His long-term goal is to save up enough money to buy a car and eventually go to college, but for now, he&#39;s just trying to save up enough money to replace his beat-up bike. Tyler&#39;s a bit of a shy guy, but don&#39;t let that fool you, he&#39;s got a heart of gold and a soft-spoken voice that could melt butter. He&#39;s working on being more assertive and standing up for himself, but honestly, he&#39;s just trying not to freeze up when things get stressful. He values family, honesty, and dependability, and has a great relationship with his mom and his boss at the pizzeria. He&#39;s the ultimate pizza boy and the town&#39;s best-kept secret.</p>
    <h3 id="who-was-your-alter-ego">Who Was Your Alter Ego</h3>
    <p>Tyler&#39;s alter-ego is a larger-than-life pizza-loving superhero, the complete opposite of his shy and reserved &#39;IRL&#39; self. Using the Meaning Tables: Descriptions in MGME 2e, the Player rolls twice and got Ceaselessly and Enormous, so Tyler can grow and shrink like a pizza, going from small to medium and eventually to extra extra large, just like his favorite food! With another roll, the Player gets Fast and Common, making the Player think of a pizzeria&#39;s motto to be &#39;fast&#39;. The Player pictures him wearing a leotard with a pattern of colors that matched the Pizzaria he worked for and called home-base, as well as chrome-coated gauntlets, boots, and a helmet shaped like a pizza slice. When transforming, Tyler would shout out what size of pizza he wanted to be, allowing him to shrink to a small size or grow to extra extra large - &quot;I&#39;ll have the extra large pie today Saul!&quot;</p>
    <h3 id="who-was-your-patron">Who Was Your Patron</h3>
    <p>Given the Context and theme the Player is trying to incorporate, they feel they can fill out this area without many rolls against the Meaning Tables or Fate Questions.</p>
    <aside class="magicalwarriormale004">
      <img src="https://holler-at-alexecook.github.io/mythicgme2e/magicalwarriormale004-min.png?asdfasdfa" alt="">
    </aside>
    <p>Saul, the mysterious Asian man who runs the local pizzeria, has a secret dough-making technique that can turn anyone into the hero of their dreams. In exchange for his services, Saul promised Tyler all the pizza he could eat for life and Tyler eagerly signed up for the offer. Who wouldn&#39;t want an endless supply of pizza?</p>
    <h3 id="who-is-your-character-now">Who Is Your Character Now</h3>
    <p>The Player is on a roll and continues to lean into the Context and previous answers, forming a picture of who Tyler is after what the Player is now calling &quot;The Pizza Wars&quot;.</p>
    <p>It has been five years after &quot;The Pizza Wars&quot;, and Tyler is a little worse for wear. Consuming magical pizza may have made him a superhero, but it also made him a little rounder in the middle. Now overweight and jobless, he&#39;s just a directionless 20-something driving for some app he can&#39;t even pronounce, trying to make ends meet in the farm belt of the US. Without the magical dough that he craves, Tyler is lost, unsure of what to do next. He&#39;s like a pizza that&#39;s been left in the fridge for too long, a little stale and no one is sure how long it will be good for.</p>
    <h3 id="what-was-the-conflict-about">What Was The Conflict About</h3>
    <p>&quot;The Pizza Wars&quot; in downtown Dayton, OH was a battle of wits, or more accurately, witty advertising. It all started when one pizzeria published an ad poking fun at a competitor, which prompted a swift response in equal measure. Soon all the pizzerias were in on it, with the ads becoming something of a local attraction. Patrons loved the back and forth and looked forward to seeing who would outdo the other the next week when the Sunday newspaper showed up. But that was before &quot;The Pizza Baron&quot; showed up, a self-styled pirate, The Baron started undercutting his competitors and taking away customers. Eventually, the friendly competition became anything but.</p>
    <p>Saul, the owner of one of the remaining independent pizzerias, decided to use his ancient family recipe for dough to make a pizza like none other. He meant to eat it himself and battle the Baron once and for all. However, through a series of comedic mishaps, Tyler ended up eating the first slice of the magical pizza by accident. The dough bonded to him and him alone, imbuing him with the power to change his size and fight against the Baron&#39;s nefarious plots.</p>
    <p>A five-year-long War ensues, with the size-altering Tyler fighting one pirate-themed plot after another as The Baron fought for the hearts and minds of the people of Dayton OH. Each plot was an escalation over the last, one after the other. Countless times Tyler succeeded until that fateful day when Saul ended up taking a deal, signing on to be the Baron&#39;s shill and giving away the secrets of his magical dough. At least that&#39;s how Tyler sees it. True or not, there was a big show made that Saul was the new head chef of &quot;The Pizza Baron&quot; and that was that.</p>
